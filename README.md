# AARPG PROJECT
This is a basic AARPG project I made following [Michael Games'](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelGamesOfficial) tutorials, usign his free assets as well

## Mechanics
The mechanics I have implemented so far are:
1. Simple tileset and tilemap
2. Top-Down 2D character with a State Machine
3. Slime enemies with State Machine
4. Attacking and killing enemies
5. Health Points for the player
